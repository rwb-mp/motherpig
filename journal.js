The lead-off batter for the Athletics reached in each of the first 5 innings but Corbin pitched out of trouble until the 5th when the A's broke through for 2 runs. Corbin's line over 4-2/3 innings: 2 runs on 7 hits, a walk and 5 K's. The bullpen held the A's scoreless the rest of the way, but 2 runs were all the A's needed. The Rangers scored in the 6th on a Higashioka double and a Heim single. The Rangers added 2 more baserunners in the inning but Garcia popped up in the infield to leave them loaded. Semien led off the 9th with a single and moved to 2B on a Jung groundout, but Garcia struck out and Dustin Harris grounded out giving J.P. Sears his 5th straight win over the Rangers. The Rangers were 1-for-7 with runners in scoring position.`

  recap: `Jacob deGrom (0-1, 3.33) vs. Jacob Lopez in his 1st start of the season. It was a great game for the hitters who feasted off Lopez and what Jared Sandler referred to as "the underbelly of the A's bullpen". The Ranger hitters combined for 18 hits and 9 walks including an 8-run 6th inning. deGrom cruised through 6 shutout innings on 65 pitches, 4 hits, 7 K's and no walks. Dane Dunning pitched the final 3 innings in his first appearance of the season after being called up from Round Rock.`

  recap: `Nathan Eovaldi (2-2, 2.21) vs. Luis Severino (1-3, 3.49). The Rangers wasted another quality start by Eovaldi who gave up a run in 6 innings on 6 hits, no walks, and 8 K's. The lineup generated plenty of scoring opportunities but went 1-for-11 with RISP. The first 2 hitters reached in the 3rd, 6th, and 8th but failed to score. Burger hitting in the 3-spot struck out 4 times leaving 5 runners on base, and Langford in the leadoff spot went 0-for-5 stranding 6 runners. The A's exploded for 6 runs in the 9th on a pair of homers against the trio of Garcia, Jackson, and Armstrong. At the end of April the Rangers have the 6th best ERA in MLB and the offense is ranked 27th in runs scored.`

  recap: `Tyler Mahle (3-0, 1.23) vs. Jeffrey Springs (3-3, 5.18). It was another quality start for Mahle who pitched 6 innings giving up a run on 5 hits and a walk, striking out 6. In Springs' previous start he gave up 7 runs to the 8-23 White Sox. Opponents were hitting .432 against Springs' fastball, but the Rangers' lineup could manage only 2 singles over 6 innings. The Rangers were 0-for-4 with RISP and have now lost 5 of 7 against the Athletics. After the game Jake Burger was sent down to Round Rock and Blaine Crimm (.313/.365/.565) was called up.`

  score: 'L 13-1',
  recap: `Jack Leiter (2-0, 2.03) vs. Bryan Woo (3-1, 3.09). A solo HR by Cal Raleigh in the 4th and a grand slam in the 5th gave the Mariners more runs than they would need against the anemic Rangers' offense. Woo pitched 6 innings, retiring the first 14 hitters he faced until Heim singled harmlessly in the 5th. Mariners' pitching retired the next 12 hitters until Smith homered to right with 2 outs in the ninth followed by a Langford single. The Smith HR ended a streak of 281 Ranger AB's without a HR. The Rangers' record fell below .500 for the first time since their opening day loss. Blaine Crim went 0-for 3 with 2 K's in his MLB debut.`

  recap: `Patrick Corbin (2-1, 3.79) vs. Luis Castillo (3-2, 3.62). It was Seager's 1st game back from the 10-day IL. J.P. Crawford homered on Corbin's 1st pitch of the game 369-feet to RF. The Rangers answered in the 5th when Seager led off with a single and Heim scored him on a 2-out RBI-single. Corbin retired 12 in a row at one point and left after 5-2/3, giving up a run on 5 hits and 2 walks with 2 K's. Chris Martin pitched the 9th and gave up a leadoff double to the hot-hitting Polanco who scored on an RBI-single by Telez. In the bottom of the 9th Semien walked with 1 out and Heim moved him to 2nd on a ground-out to 1B. Garcia struck out on a slider way out of the zone to end the game. 1 run on 5 hits for the Rangers who now have lost 4 straight and 9 of 11.`
